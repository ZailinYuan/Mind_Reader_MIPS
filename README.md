# Mind_Reader_MIPS
A Mind Reader Game, for a feel of the game: https://www.mathsisfun.com/games/mind-reader.html

 The Mind Reader Game description would be that is an .asm program that will ask a player to think of a number. Then the program asks a series of question of yes or no questions to determine what number that is. The range of numbers starts from 1 to 63. Six different cards are displayed. Each card displays a series of randomized numbers. Each card asks if the number you have in mind is displaying on the card. Each card displays a background color and colored font. There is music that plays when you first run the program and when you decide to the quit the program. The program calculates the result quite accurately as if it had read a mind for the correct result.  
Features:
1.	Checking input: 
When asking yes or no, if user input are not ‘y’ or ‘n’, continue to input until an ‘y’ or ‘n’ are typed.
2.	Graphics:
Make good use of BitMap tool in MIPS to achieve good looking user interface and demonstration.
Colorful card display and beautiful character design.
3.	 Music:
Thanks to MIDI part in the MIPS Mars simulator. Every time the game starts, Ode To Joy will play, and each time the game ends, Little Star will be heard.
